I opened a city up to him that he didn't have access to. He was so successful in my city that I would hear about him from other people that I had never met.

Many of our customers have been in the same position, and they've shared some incredible stories with us.  Customers who purchased the ${model} have told us how it transformed their weekends and vacations. They found that it added a new dimension to their family time, creating memories that they'll cherish forever.  One of our recent customers, John, initially had similar reservations. However, after taking the ${model} for a test drive, he couldn't resist its appeal. He mentioned how it rekindled his love for the open road and brought his family closer together.  Another customer, Sarah, told us how she discovered hidden backcountry roads and beautiful spots she never knew existed before owning this motorcycle.  It's stories like these that remind us how life-changing the ${model} can be. We'd love to help you create your own memorable experiences. If you're open to it, I can schedule a test drive for you.

MSRP's will also be rising and our cost has gone up so the discounts will be smaller. I was talking to an old retired dealer owner who had brp, he was like I don't know how you guys do it, its smaller margins and costs just keep going up and the dealers cant seem to keep people. I'm not saying don't go because you never know when a dealer owner needs to pay his staff or his bills so he doesn't loose his location, but the days of cost units for sale are done.
