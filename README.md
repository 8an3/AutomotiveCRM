In a nut shell, a crm coded by sales professionals, who are still on the sales floor everyday. Started as a project to be a solution for one small problem. That solution worked so much better then anything currently available in the industry, I started to look at what else can be improved. We don't have time to get bogged down by the issues that are in the industry and in every CRM wasting countless hours of every employees time. If the actual person who codes it, NEEDS TO USE IT, the end user experience turns out to be like no other in the industry. Since all the little issues that add more time to your job, never get fixed because. Or making the changes to make it that more efficient, does this action really need a button to be pressed 6 times, can it not just be one?. If something can be made more efficient, I change it. I don't have the time to waste on stupid tasks that can be helped with tech. Not only seeing the issue or the needed improvement first hand, immediately on site. I strive to make it a polished experience for each and every role in the dealer. Each role has different processes that need to be done, it creates a lot bigger work load for the person coding it. By why not change the crm to help that person complete their duties, their only going to be doing that process 100,000 times in their time working that role, times the total amount of process that role needs to do. We break it down and find a solution where the CRM elegantly helps you complete that process, faster, guaranteed. Saving untold hours of frustration among the staff doing every day menial tasks, but also saving you tons of money in salaries, every year.

Already have a CRM and worried about switching due to the headaches it may cause?

When I was first testing / using the platform, my dealers owners / management didn't even know I was using a completely different software to complete my job duties. To this day, they are completely unaware that I was using a different CRM to sell, manage deals and more. To them, it all looked the same.

AVAILABLE SOON, the platform will be available for individual sales people. No matter where you work... for free. You may not get every feature that is available, due to features needing the entire dealer to make it work. I promise, it will still save you countless hours in the tasks you do most. In turn letting you make more sales, instead of worrying about paperwork or menial tasks.

To have this incredible tool, for free... to make you more money, reduce headaches and the tasks you need to do?

You don't even need to think about it. There's nothing but upside to make this change in your career. So if you try it and you hate the color of it so much you don't want to use it for that reason?

Great, didn't cost you a dime to find that out.

By not at least trying it, your doing your professional career in sales a disservice.

I'll be honest, this was the second idea I had for the project, to reskin the sales dashboard on my CRM. To help me do all the things that have nothing to do with sales, but still need to be done for the job, that every crm seems to continuously add more activities to click to get the same process / part of your job done, taking up even more of your time. In turn this would allow me to focus on selling more. Every CRM on the market wastes so much of your time.

So if your looking for that one change to make in your sales career to boost sales this year, with a 100% guarantee of increasing them because it does not rely on motivation, salesmanship or the secret (If your still looking for it.)... You found the change that needs to be done, no matter the level your currently at in sales. Brand new? Great, you won't have the same headaches as more senior sales people had to endure. Selling for 10 years? I don't need to tell you twice that the crm you use sucks in more ways than we can count. Swearing at your screen randomly throughout the day.

How does it making switching so easy? When developing the program, I needed to test it in the real world. There is no chance in hell the owners or managers would permit me to use this instead of the dealers CRM. So I just started using it, if someone found out I would just beg forgiveness and hope it all blows over. That conversation never came. Day to day I was using a completely different CRM system, and no could tell anything was different or wrong. I was inputting all the same data in the new crm, that I would have from the old one. So anyone looking at a deal, couldn't tell the difference. To this day they don't know that. So if it was that seamless where, it not only did NOT disrupt anyone's job but was so great at it no even notice, not a single person. What does that mean for you? What if we could just get the sales team on it first, try it. If everything does work better, switch one dept at a time instead of the entire dealer. It wouldn't be as jarring as training an entire dealers staff on a new system and then everyone making the same mistakes for weeks on end. This way you have seasoned users that can help in the dealer already if someone needs help. Which may not even happen, because of how we simplified each roles use of the software. Instead of giving everyone, everything and saying good luck. This gives employees too much information, even on data that they don't need or should have had access to in the first place.
