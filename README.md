## Some Details

This repo is kind of over-engineered to have high flexibility and cover a lot of use cases for different applications/projects/products (especially what I'm working with several other people). Currently includes the Remix HMR & HDR setup with both Vercel config and Express server on development as per Remix `v1.14`. The config is just combining the templates from Remix with Express and Vercel based on the environment.

Compared to [the older `rewinds`](https://github.com/mhaidarhanif/rewinds-legacy), this newer version uses [`shadcn/ui`](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) as the base components style and setup for full stack app development inspired by [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg). The main adaptation reason is that this repo uses Remix, not Next.js as the full-stack framework.

## Some Background

Why create this? Well, because I had a lot of recent projects with this same stack.

# Development

## Install Dependencies

Before running your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed using your preferred package manager agent:

```sh
npm i
yarn i
pnpm i
```

Or if using [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni) which can autodetect the agent:

```sh
pnpm add -g @antfu/ni  # install once
ni                     # can auto choose npm/yarn/pnpm
```

## Setup Environment Variables

Use plain `.env` file for local development:

```sh
cp -i .env.example .env
# `-i` or `--interactive` will prompt before overwrite
# then edit `.env` as you prefer
```

Or use [Doppler](https://doppler.com) CLI to manage them:

```sh
doppler secrets download --no-file --format env > .env
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to setup the environment variables here, on Vercel, or on your preferred deployment target. Otherwise the app will break on production. That's why Doppler is recommended and there are some preset strings in the `.env.example` which you can copy directly.

## Prisma ORM and Database Connection

It's up to you which database/DBMS you want to use with the app. This repo recommends using MySQL on PlanetScale. But avoid using SQLite because it doesn't have `model`.createMany()` function. For example:

```sh
DATABASE_URL='mysql://username:pscale_pw_password@region.connect.psdb.cloud/name?sslaccept=strict'
```

While in development, you can also visualize the schema with [Prismaliser](https://prismaliser.app).

## Run Development Server

Afterward, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
nr dev
```

This will run both the Remix server and Express server with HMR enabled. Then wait until you see this info on the terminal:

```sh
üìÄ Remix on Express server listening on port :3000
Loading environment variables from .env
üíø Built in 0s
```

Open up [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.

## TypeScript and ESLint Server

When you update some significant changes in the TypeScript config, ESLint config, or just generated a new Prisma schema, you can restart.

```sh
> TypeScript: Restart TS Server
> ESLint: Restart ESLint Server
> Prisma: Restart Language Server
```

# Deployment

## Vercel

As this repo was made after having run the `create-remix` command and selected "Vercel" as a deployment target, you only need to [import your Git repository](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel, and it will be deployed.

Just keep in mind to set up the environment variables, especially:

```sh
REMIX_APP_NAME=
REMIX_APP_EMAIL=
REMIX_ADMIN_EMAIL=
REMIX_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
REMIX_SESSION_SECRET=
DATABASE_URL=
```

Or if using Doppler, there's the auto sync integration.

- <https://doppler.com/integrations/vercel>
- <https://vercel.com/integrations/doppler>

If you'd like to avoid using a Git repository, you can also deploy the directory by running [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli):

```sh
ni -g vercel
vercel
```

It is generally recommended to use a Git repository, because future commits will then automatically be deployed by Vercel, through its [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

# Important Notes

## Tailwind CSS Config

Use [uicolors.app](https://uicolors.app/create) to generate the color tokens easily. Then replace what's inside `tailwind.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        brand: {
          50: "#f2f9fd",
          100: "#e5f1f9",
          200: "#c5e2f2",
          300: "#92cae7",
          400: "#57aed9",
          500: "#3399cc",
          600: "#2277a7",
          700: "#1d6087",
          800: "#1b5171",
          900: "#1c445e",
        },
        surface: {
          50: "#f4f8f9",
          100: "#dce7eb",
          200: "#b8ced7",
          300: "#8dacbb",
          400: "#65899c",
          500: "#4b6e81",
          600: "#3a5667",
          700: "#324653",
          800: "#2b3944",
          900: "#0a0d0f",
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Remix Entry Files

Since Remix v1.14, you might notice that the entry files are implicitly defined. At the moment, if you need to deploy a Remix app I still suggest revealing or explicitly defining the entry files to make it work smoothly. Although this repo already has the entry files.

```sh
npx remix reveal
```

## HMR Workaround

> This setup has been done in this Rewinds template.

To enable HMR and HDR, at least as per Remix v1.14, when not primarily using Express server only (like using Vercel and another server), we have to do this in the `package.json` scripts.

```json
{
  "dev": "run-p dev:*",
  "dev:remix": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development remix dev",
  "dev:serve": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon --require dotenv/config ./server-express.js --watch ./server-express.js"
}
```

If you don't need the HMR, simply run `dev:remix` script only as this will run without using the Express server:

```sh
nr dev:remix
```

If using pnpm, you also have to install `react-refresh` to resolve the HMR dependency:

```sh
ni -D react-refresh
```

When running locally in development mode, use either the Express server or Vercel. This by default does not understand the Vercel lambda module format, so we fall back to the standard build output.

```js
const isDevelopment = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

module.exports = {
  ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
  server: isDevelopment ? undefined : "./server-vercel.js",
  serverBuildPath: isDevelopment ? "build/index.js" : "api/index.js",
  appDirectory: "app",
  assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
  publicPath: "/build/",

  future: {
    unstable_dev: true,
    unstable_tailwind: true,
  },
};
```
