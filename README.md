In a nut shell, a crm coded by sales professionals, who are still on the sales floor everyday. Started as a project to be a solution for one small problem. That solution worked so much better then anything currently available in the industry, I started to look at what else can be improved. We don't have time to get bogged down by the issues that are in the industry and in every CRM wasting countless hours of every employees time. If the actual person who codes it, NEEDS TO USE IT, the end user experience turns out to be like no other in the industry. Since all the little issues that add more time to your job, never get fixed because. Or making the changes to make it that more effecient, does this action really need a button to be pressed 6 times, can it not just be one?. If something can be made more effecient, I change it. I don't have the time to waste on stupid tasks that can be helped with tech. Not only seeing the issue or the needed improvement first hand, immediatly on site. I strive to make it a polished experience for each and every role in the dealer. Each role has different processes that need to be done, it creates a lot bigger work load for the person coding it. By why not change the crm to help that person complete their duties, their only going to be doing that process 100,000 times in their time working that role, times the total amount of process that role needs to do. We break it down and find a solution where the CRM elegantly helps you complete that process, faster, garaunteed. Saving untold hours of frustration among the staff doing every day menial tasks, but also saving you tons of money in salaries, every year.

Already have a CRM and worried about switching due to the headaches it may cause?
When I was first testing / using the platform, my dealers owners / managment didn't even know I was using a completely different software to complete my job duties. To this day, they are completely unaware that I was using a different CRM to sell, manage deals and more. To them, it all looked the same.

AVAILABLE SOON, the platform will be available for individual sales people. No matter where you work... for free. You may not get every feature that is available, due to features needing the entire dealer to make it work. I promise, it will still save you countless hours in the tasks you do most. In turn letting you make more sales, instead of worrying about paperwork or menial tasks.
To have this incredible tool, for free... to make you more money, reduce headaches and the tasks you need to do?
You don't even need to think about it. Theres nothing but upside to make this change in your career. So if you try it and you hate the color of it so much you dont want to use it for that reason?
Great, didn't cost you a dime to find that out.
By not atleast trying it, your doing your professional career in sales a diservice.
I'll be honest, this was the second idea I had for the project, to reskin the sales dashboard on my CRM. To help me do all the things that have nothing to do with sales, but still need to be done for the job, that every crm seems to continiosly add more activies to click to get the same process / part of your job done, taking up even more of your time. In turn this would allow me to focus on selling more. Every CRM on the market wastes so much of your time.
So if your looking for that one change to make in your sales career to boost sales this year, with a 100% garauntee of increasing them because it does not rely on motivation, salesmanship or the secret (If your still looking for it.)... You found the change that needs to be done, no matter the level your currently at in sales. Brand new? Great, you won't have the same headaches as more senior sales people had to endure. Selling for 10 years? I don't need to tell you twice that the crm you use sucks in more ways than we can count. Swearing at your screen randomly throughtout the day.

How does it making switching so easy? When developing the program, I needed to test it in the real world. There is no chance in hell the owners or managers would permit me to use this instead of the dealers CRM. So I just started using it, if someone found out I would just beg foregivness and hope it all blows over. That conversation never came. Day to day I was using a completely different CRM system, and no could tell anything was different or wrong. I was inputting all the same data in the new crm, that I would have from the old one. So anyone looking at a deal, couldn't tell the differece. To this day they don't know that. So if it was that seamless where, it not only did NOT disrupt anyones job but was so great at it no even notice, not a single person. What does that mean for you? What if we could just get the sales team on it first, try it. If everything does work better, switch one dept at a time instead of the entire dealer. It wouldn't be as jarring as training an entire dealers staff on a new system and then everyone making the same mistakes for weeks on end. This way you have seasoned users that can help in the dealer already if someone needs help. Which may not even happen, because of how we simplified each roles use of the software. Instead of giving everyone, everything and saying good luck. This gives employees too much information, even on data that they don't need or should have had access to in the first place.

## tl but worth the read

The tech industry has a known problem for making things complicated and unintuitive. Don't believe me? When someone asks what you do for work? The average tech person says I work in tech, or programming. But for us who work or know the field, that is not an answer haha. They don't know how to explain their job in a simple enough way for people to digest.

We're not usually a people person... which in turn effects the projects we code. More often than not, we can't put ourselves in the end users shoes (or don't have enough time to) and see how this software will effect them. How you see the program and how the remaining 98% of the worlds population, not in tech, see's the program are two total different realities. Which leads to a lost in translation type of thought and then pushes us to where the programmer thinks they did a great job, they're colleagues think they did a great job. In actuality any person who uses the program for work on a day to day basis.... _fucking hates you._

It's not your fault, you don't use the program every day for work, you move onto the next project. It's an industry problem not a programmer level issue. Which is where this crm blow's every single brand out of the water. I had to make this out of necessity, it started for a very small issue with my job. To quote auto units in 5 secs or less with 0 errors. It worked so well I started to look at other things I might be able to learn how to code. One... hundred rabbit holes later, its turned into a full blown crm.

Every position in the dealer, coded with the same care as the sales dept. The proof? We will just go over one position and one process in there day to day job. The sales calls. We call a customer, log it as called in the system as completed, make a new appointment x days away and leave yourself a note as to where you are in the sales process / what you talked about with the client. THAT WAY you do not have to go back through your previous communications with that customer, which could end up costing you 10-15 mins per call.

### the problem

I aim to do about a 100 calls a day.
The avg sales person could complete that process in 1:30 to 2:00. More so 2 mins or longer because the average sales person isn't coming in to work every day going wire to wire and trying to be the absolute best they can be. Now if your bad with computers.... or just slow this can climb even higher. I've seen some people take 5-10 per call.
Lets do 2 mins to keep it simple.
100 x 2 = 200 mins per day wasted.
So we waste **3.33333 hours per day**, on just this one process.
In sales you don't take as many days off, due to the industry, so I work 260 days per year.

> (Sigh, I hate seeing this math.)

In a year, **865.78 hours or 36 days, wasted**. Tech is supposed to be the **solution**, not the **problem**.
So for every sales person in a dealership they are wasting about $14,000 in salaries a year (about) to needlessly click buttons, that didn't need to be there in the first place.

For the average person reading this here, 'Ahh 14k is nothing'.
You work in tech and in that world it is nothing, lets be honest. But in every other industry, this is a lot of money wasted. It takes a lot effort to make a $1 in profit. Then to have it wasted, so stupidly and on a process that can be fixed is not smart business practices.
Think of the scaling problem, you have 10 sales people in your dealer? (What about the other employees?) 140,000k wasted... What if you own more than one dealer? (which most dealer/dealer groups more often than not, own more than one.) The worst part of this, our job is full of these time wasting processes that have to be done, and this is just one of them. There are also another 20 or so positions in the dealer using the same crm, but the sales side is usually where all the focus goes when building the crm. The other jobs have a worst time with it unfortunately.

### the solution

That same process, I got it down to a second. **Whether you are good at computers or not**.
That number is for clients who do not pick up the phone, or you contact them by email/text. On any other call I've gotten the number down to 10-30 seconds, can be even shorter if your good at it.

If your a programmer at a crm company or you own that company and want some guidance in this, touch base. This is a problem that needs to be addressed by more than one company. Think of the larger crms out there, lets get into those numbers quickly, these will seem impossible. (Even though the numbers above, already meet that.)

### problems at scale

Lets keep with the numbers of 10 sales people per dealer.
I know some of the bigger crm companies have more than 100 clients... This is a low number in my opinion, but we need to keep it simple and small enough to be beleiveable.
**That one crm company, is costing their clients 14 million dollars a year in salaries.**
On a simple coding problem... That no one even dares to look at, or even bring up. When I brought it up with our dealers crm, I was discussing this issue with a high level manager. They immediatly started to say, well you can cheat the system and this and that, but you can't cheat the system successfully. Ya one week your times can be shorter, but the next round of calls, your now back tracking through all your correspondance with every single customer. It doesn't save you time in any form. AND the conversation ended then and there and the crm never saw an update... That's fucking disgusting.
What if that crm company has 500 clients?
**$70 million**....
Whether your in tech or not, you cannot deny it now, that is a lot of money.

### implement

The code is here, I'm still coding it so I do not have the time right now to give you a walkthrough on how to use/implement it, since I still have my 9-5 sales job. If this is something you want to implement, its available.

### consult

If you want a consult on how to not be one of the we discussed, touch base and we can get together. It would be worth it. I've come up with processes that are not in use in the industry, by anyone. Even the brands that try to control their dealer network, with the vast amount of resources and money at their disposal, haven't come up with some of the ideas I've implemented. To be honest, they were pretty simple solutions, BUT they have to be implemented at the right time in the process. Which means the crm company would have to implement it. There is no way they will do that for you.
I'll probably even reach out to a couple of the bigger brands that would value this.
Beleive it or not, there are brands that make it harder for their dealer network more than others to sell their products. For example, Manitou. Their product stack, is insane. Whenever I sell a brand, I always go to the competition to see how they sell it. Who sells it better, what can I take away from them so I can implement it and become better and so on. I've never seen a brand where people had so much trouble simplifying the buying process when it came to explaining the product stack and its pricing. The dealer I was at, it took 2-3 hours to price a unit out (If you were lucky), when they got good at it. That's just pricing it, nothing else. That is not discussing options with the customer, and lets be honest if it took you three hours to price it. You are not upselling your customer on anything. More often than not, what came from the factory the way it landed in the dealer, was how it was sold. It's a shame because they are missing out on so much money up selling. So why not just... make it easier? Didn't think that was a paradigm you had to wrap your head around. My quoting system, prices out a manitou unit it in under 2 minutes. Need to discuss different options? No problem, the quoting system made it dummy proof so you couldn't make a mistake selling a option that couldn't be fitted. You could have someone on their first day, input the base unit, then go over engines with the client, then interiors and so on. It's so easy, the client could do it themselves. These are stupid problems, that have solutions. People just don't want to sit down and think it through and test it to make sure, it actually saves times and if it even makes sense to implement. Again coders need to move to the next project asap, they don't have the luxury to complete this step.

### closing thoughts

The biggest issue that crm companies have, when selling their own crms.
Flipping the customer to their crm. It is such a huge deal for a dealer to switch crms to the point where, no matter how bad the crm is that is currently in use. They would rather stick it out with that horrible crm, and cause daily headaches for literally every single staff member, then switch because it is already in use and would cause endless headaches to make the switch. It's that big of an issue for a dealer to switch systems.
The only times a dealer does make the switch, is whenever their opening a new location or closing the entire dealer for a time, for renos for example.
Why hasn't this simple problem been fixed? It an industry wide problem. You could dominate the market if you could solve this.
Why is this crm, made by a sales person who never went to university, the only one that has the capability to easily get customers into another crm without crippling its owners with massive headaches every day in their professional lives.
If your in sales or own that crm company, you know at that point, you are not selling them.
I remember one crm sales person, we'll call him Dave, he didn't sell at all. He showed up at the dealer, at random intervals, and bugged the owners for 10 years. What a giant fucking waste of time, and I'm sorry, you fail as a sales person if thats your sales strategy. It works, barely, but go into another industry and save yourself from every horror of being in sales. Go be a regional manager at the very least, like c'mon do yourself a favour.
When I was using my crm... I didn't even tell the owners... they didn't even notice I was using a completely different system day to day... That's how unaffected the rest of the dealer was when I used this completely different system in that dealer.

(Should have I told them? No, but yes, probably, if it was any other industry. But we're in sales, beg for forgiveness, not permission.

Because you will NEVER get the premission, n e v e r.
You need to bend / break the rules, get in shit with a lot of yelling directed towards you, may even get you fired because of it. Then show / prove that it infact does do a better job (In so doing your telling your managers that they are complete morons, even when you don't say say it to their face, and they feel that your threatening their jobs now. They do not like this. lol.), then it gets implemented and everyone forgets it ever happened.

If you were able to keep your job, you won't get any thanks or bonuses, everyone will hate you anyways(mainly because your a super star sales person), but atleast your job no longer sucks and you can sell more.
I have never made a worthwhile / useful improvement / impactful change in a sales enviroment without doing what I just went over.
Does it suck? Fuck yeah it does. I don't want to get yelled at, who would want that? But the manager, Dave, ain't doing shit around here to improve... anything for anyones life at their job.
But get good at sales and who the fuck cares if you get fired (If they missed that oppurtunity to improve, sorry to say this but they're just average under achieving loosers.). You just move on to the next place, because every company is looking for a rock star sales person.
I haven't been hired in a sales position, and gone through the regular hiring process in over a decade. I've always been head hunted. If I drop a resume off somewhere, it ends with the same result. We can't afford you and you will move the first oppurtunity that comes your way, even if I say I won't.
And push comes to shove, the only people who will do what I just talked about, to be completely honest, are rock star sales people, anyone else who reads this will just think I'm crazy... and that's ok.

One last thing on the getting fired part. IF you are in a job for more than 3 years, you are now getting left behind as far as your pay goes in the form of raises, bonuses and current industry standard pay structures. (I've only worked at one place that this was not true.)
Due to the global fuck ups that we call politicians, who seem hell bent at watching their countries burn for whatever reason that implores them to push through... the crazy / stupid policies that they do. Our $ looses its value faster than ever, how does this effect you? You would make more money, jumping from job to job every 2-3 years in your industry, does not matter what the industry is.
Your boss will not give you enough in whatever they call a pay raise at the end of the year, commission raise, doesn't matter, to ensure you keep up with the industry standards at the current time.
Not only that, due to the experience over the last 2-3 years you may even get a 10x-15x pay raise, in comparison, due to being a senior bullshitter now, congrats.
Instead of staying in that one job for 60k, you could move on to the next and make over 90k. Theres nothing wrong with getting fired (Most of the time, unless it is and you did what I told you to do. Then it is infact your fault. But you don't want to work with a bunch of loosers anyways, so its a win-win. They are doing more damage to you than you know, by holding you back.), it typically comes down to the fact that the business you were working for, can no longer afford you.
The next time you get fired for no reason, just remember it's not your fault, keep your chin up and go knock it out of the park at the next gig.)

### getting back on track...

Now if you had that in your sales pitch?

You would be able to switch over so many clients to your product. But... no one does... Don't be Dave...

You get no headaches, actually comes to think of it less headaches since its removing your current problems, and save 100's of thousands in salaries a year in the process.
It would not only be detremental to your business / dealer AND your bottom line NOT to switch, but plainly put, your a moron if you don't...
Sorry if that offends you, but theres no downside which means theres only an upside to switching. So why do you even need to think about it? You don't. I just came from the heavens and I am handing you a great solution to your problems (Some of them, you didn't even know you had.) with no draw backs.
Do you hate money sir?
Do you hate it when your employees can work better and be more effecient at completing tasks, which in turn... gives you even more money in the end?
If you still say no, you hate money and you just want to willow in the pain of your own existence and give youself nothing but headaches and take the hard path in your agonizing quest through life.

Give me one objection at this point that can't be overcome with an easy answer?

Every problem has a solution, maybe it's because I did not go to university to learn to code that gives me an advantage. Due to one reason, I truly beleive every obstacle can be over come in coding, and any solution can be elegantly implemented to where it does not burden the end user. If it does, you did it wrong. It's ok though, calm down, who cares, you can just re write the code. It's that easy. Stop stressing, tell that manager to bug off, or if you dare, to take their attitude and stick it where the sun doesn't shine, because we don't have time for that kind of attitude.
And that type of manager, shouldn't be a manager. Sorry, not sorry. I've been in sales long enough, to not beat around the bush and be 100% transparent and honest. NOT only would that person be happier in a another career, they might actually do a good job for once.

Tangent, but worth its weight in reading;
I can say this with confidence (And you cannot convince me other wise.), there are more people in sales management than not, that shouldn't even be in it to begin with. Why? Because most super star sales people, make horrible fucking managers. Sorry, but while, weirdly, some horrible sales people make great managers. More worringly, most management positions (95% of them.) are filled out of necissity, by someone like Dave, he was what we could fill the position with at the time and it was the best we could do given the resources at hand. Do you think this a sound business practice? The best we could do, with the resources at hand will be the result you get... probably worse than that to be honest, it's Dave were talking about here.
Unfortunately, that same bad sales person manager cannot lift a sales person from the status of bottom feeder, to super stardom, they just can't... Unless they themselves get to that point first. Then they know the way, with all the struggles and successes to make that journey to the other side and become a star in sales.
But they can do the job though! The actual managing job because its a completely different position than that of a sales position, and a million % better than a super star sales person, who sucks at managing. Because sales people don't manage... anything. 90% of them can't even manage their emotions. Most sales people, they attack the first customer they can, till they have to move on to the next one. This practice does not make good managers. So why do you people keep hiring them?

Speaking of honesty and transparency, if you as a sales person make that one change, your sales career will forever change for the better. In ways you couldn't imagine, even in your wildest dreams.
Making this change, the result would be as if god himself came down from the heavens. Looked at you with all your problems and issues that was holding you down by your shoulders and removed them... Then took his time to brush off the remaining issues at a leisurely pace as if it was dust left behind, and banished them to god knows where. I shit you not.
I know, transparency and honesty are not associated with sales people, in any way shape or form. Due to the fact that the average consumer thinks we are the reincarnation of the devil himself, (Out to get every last soul to sign some horrible contract they can't get out of till the end of days, on a product they didn't even want. lol.) but if you do make that change you will be forever grateful.
I will never go back to lying, no matter how bad it seems like that conversation will be with that one customer no one wants to deal with, still won't do it.
Your life, overnight will become unfathomably easier.
The trick though? Because there is a trick to it. Admit when you don't know, because it's ok, someone out there... has the answer for you, just go get it. That asshole customer can't get mad at you for not knowing, no one knows everything.
If he does, rip his contract and tell him to shop else where. Give his deposit back and wish him a great day. Because yours just got a lot better, you will never have to deal with that prick again.
