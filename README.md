Summed up, a crm coded by sales professionals, who are still on the sales floor everyday.
Started as a project to be a solution for one small problem. That solution worked so much better then anything currently available in the industry, I started to look at what else can be improved.
We don't, countless tasks wasting hours of every employees time. If the actual person who codes it, NEEDS TO USE IT, the end user experience turns out to be like no other. But because this is not what happens, all the fixes that would turn into a great experience, never see the light of day.
If something can be made more efficient, I change it. Not only seeing the issue or the needed improvement first hand in the dealer. I strive to make it a polished experience for each and every role.
Each role has different processes that need to be done, it creates a lot more work for the person coding it but the end result cannot be denied. We make the necessary changes to the crm to help that person complete their duties. They're only going to be doing that process 100,000 times in their time working that role.
We break it down and find a solution where the CRM elegantly helps you complete that process, faster, guaranteed.
Saving untold hours of frustration among the staff doing every day menial tasks, but also saving you tons of money in salaries, every year.

### Already have a CRM and worried about switching due to the headaches it may cause?

When I was first testing / using the platform, my dealers owners / management didn't even know I was using a completely different software to complete my job duties. To this day, they are completely unaware that I was using a different CRM to sell, manage deals and more. To them, it all looked the same.

**AVAILABLE SOON,** the platform will be available for **individual sales people.** No matter where you work... **for free.** You may not get every feature that is available, due to features needing the entire dealer to make it work. I promise, it will still save you countless hours in the tasks you do most. In turn letting you make more sales, instead of worrying about paperwork or menial tasks.

To have this incredible tool, for free... to make you more money, reduce headaches and helps you complete the tasks you need to do?

You don't even need to think about it. There's nothing but upside to make this change in your career. If you try it and hate it?

Great, didn't cost you a dime to find that out.

By not at least trying it, your doing your professional career in sales a disservice.

So if your looking for that one change to make in your sales career to boost sales this year. With a 100% guarantee of increasing them because it does not rely on motivation, salesmanship or the secret (If your still looking for it.)... You found the change that needs to be done, no matter the level your currently at in sales. Brand new? Great, you won't have the same headaches as more senior sales people had to endure. Selling for 10 years? I don't need to tell you twice that the crm you use sucks in more ways than we can count. Swearing at your screen randomly throughout the day.
