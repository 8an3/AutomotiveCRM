In a nut shell, a crm made for sales people designed and coded by sales people.

## tl but did read

The tech industry has a known problem for making things complicated and unintuitive. Don't believe me? When someone asks what you do for work? The average tech person says I work in tech, or programming. But for us who work or know the field, that is not an answer haha. They don't know how to explain their job in a simple enough way for people to digest.

We're not usually a people person... which in turn effects the projects they we with code. More often than not, we can't put themselves in the end users shoes and see how this software will effect them. How you see the program and how 98% of the worlds population, not in tech, see's the program are two total different things. Which leads to a lost in translation type of thought and then pushes us to where the programmer thinks they did a great job, they're colleagues think they did a great job. In actuality any person who uses the program for work on a day to day basis.... _fucking hates you._

It's not your fault, you don't use the program every day for work, you move onto the next project. Which is where this crm blow's every single brand out of the water. I had to make this out of necessity, for a very small portion of my job. To quote auto units in 5 secs or less with 0 errors. It worked so well I started to look at other things I might be able to learn how to code. One... hundred rabbit holes later, its turned into a full crm.

Every position in the dealer, coded with the same care as the sales dept. The proof? We will just go over one position and one process in that day to day job. The calls, we call a customer, log it as called in the system, make a new appointment x days away and leave yourself a note as to where you are in the sales process / what you talked about with the client. THAT WAY you do not have to go back through your previous communications with that customer, which could end up costing you 10-15 mins per call.

### the problem

I aim to do about a 100 calls a day.
The avg sales person could complete that process in 1:30 to 2:00. More so 2 mins or longer because the average sales person isn't coming in to work every day going wire to wire and trying to be the absolute best they can be. Now if your bad with computers.... or just slow this can climb high quickly. I've seen some people take 5-10 per call.
Lets do 2 mins for easy math.
100 x 2 = 200 mins per day wasted.
So we waste **3.33333 hours per day**, on just this one process.
In sales you don't take as many days off, due to the industry, so I work 260 days per year.

> (Sigh, I hate seeing this math.)

In a year, **865.78 hours or 36 days, wasted**. Tech is supposed to be the **solution**, not the **problem**.
So for every sales person in a dealership they are wasting about $14,000 in salaries a year to needlessly click buttons.

For the average person reading this here, 'Ahh 14k is nothing'.
You work in tech and in that world it is nothing. But in every other industry, this is a lot of money wasted. It takes a lot effort make a $1 in profit. Then to have it wasted, so stupidly is not smart business practices.
Think of the scaling problem, you have 10 sales people in your dealer? 140,000k wasted... What if you own more than one dealer? (which most dealer/dealer groups more often than not, own more than one.) The worst part of this, our job is full of these time wasting processes that have to be done, and this is just one of them. There are also another 20 or so positions in the dealer using the same crm, but the sales side is usually where all the focus goes when building the crm. The other jobs have a worst time with it unfortunately.

### the solution

That same process, I got it down to a second. **Whether you are good at computers or not**.
That number is for clients who do not pick up the phone, or you email/text them. On any other call I've gotten the number down to 10-30 seconds.

If your a programmer at a crm company or you own that company and want some guidance in this, touch base. This is a problem that needs to be addressed by more than one company. Think of the larger crms out there, lets get into those numbers quickly, these will seem impossible. (Even though the numbers above, already meet that.)

### problems at scale

Lets keep with the numbers of 10 sales people per dealer.
I know some of the bigger crm companies have more than 100 clients... This is a low number in my opinion. **That one crm company, is costing their clients 14 million dollars a year in salaries.**
On a simple coding problem... That's fucking disgusting.
What if that crm company has 500 clients?
**$70 million**....
Whether your in tech or not, you cannot deny, that is a lot of money.

### implement

The code is here, I'm still coding it so I do not have the time right now to give you a walkthrough on how to use/implement it, since I still have my 9-5 sales job. If this is something you want to implement, its available.

### consult

If you want a consult on how to not be one of the we discussed, touch base and we can get together. It would be worth it. I've come up with processes that are not in use in the industry. Even the brands that try to control their dealer network, with the vast amount of resources and money at their disposal, haven't come up with some of the ideas I've implemented.
I'll probably even reach out to a couple of them. Because there are brands that make it harder for their dealer network more than others to sell their products. For example, Manitou. Their product stack, is insane. Whenever I sell a brand, I always go to the competition to see how they sell it. Who sells it better, what can I take away from them so I can implement it and become better and so on. I've never seen a brand where people had so much trouble simplifying the buying process when it came to explaining the product stack and its pricing. The dealer I was at, it took 2-3 hours to price a unit out, when they got good at it. That's just pricing it, nothing else. My quoting system did it in under 2 minutes. These are stupid problems, that have solutions.

### closing thoughts

The biggest issue that crm companies have, when selling their crms. Flipping the customer to their crm. It is such a huge deal for a dealer to switch crms to the point where, no matter how bad the crm is. They would rather stick it out with that horrible crm, then switch because it is already in use. It's that big of an issue for a dealer to switch systems.
The only times a dealer does the switch, is whenever their opening a new location or closing the entire dealer for a time, for renos or something else.
Why hasn't this simple problem been fixed? You could dominate the market if you did!
Why is this crm the only one that has the capability to easily get customers into another crm without effecting the dealers day to day life.
More often than not switching would cause headaches for the owners. If your in sales or own that crm company, you know at that point, you are not selling them at all.
When I was using mine, I didn't even tell the owners... they didn't even notice I was using a completely different system day to day... That's how unaffected the rest of the dealer was when I used my crm.
Now if you had that in your sales pitch? You would be able to switch over so many clients to your product. You get no headaches and save 100's of thousands in salaries a year in switching.
