# tl but worth the read

The tech industry has a known problem for making things complicated and unintuitive. Don't believe me? When someone asks what you do for work? The average tech person says I work in tech, or programming. But for us who work or know the field, that is not an answer haha. They don't know how to explain their job in a simple enough way for people to digest.

We're not usually a people person... which in turn effects the projects we code. More often than not, we can't put ourselves in the end users shoes (or don't have enough time to) and see how this software will effect them. How you see the program and how the remaining 98% of the worlds population, not in tech, see's the program are two total different realities. Which leads to a lost in translation type of thought and then pushes us to where the programmer thinks they did a great job, they're colleagues think they did a great job. In actuality any person who uses the program for work on a day to day basis.... _fucking hates you._

It's not your fault, you don't use the program every day for work, you move onto the next project. It's an industry problem not a programmer level issue. Which is where this crm blow's every single brand out of the water. I had to make this out of necessity, it started for a very small issue with my job. To quote auto units in 5 secs or less with 0 errors. It worked so well I started to look at other things I might be able to learn how to code. One... hundred rabbit holes later, its turned into a full blown crm.

Every position in the dealer, coded with the same care as the sales dept. The proof? We will just go over one position and one process in there day to day job. The sales calls. We call a customer, log it as called in the system as completed, make a new appointment x days away and leave yourself a note as to where you are in the sales process / what you talked about with the client. THAT WAY you do not have to go back through your previous communications with that customer, which could end up costing you 10-15 mins per call.

### the problem

I aim to do about a 100 calls a day.

The avg sales person could complete that process in 1:30 to 2:00. More so 2 mins or longer because the average sales person isn't coming in to work every day going wire to wire and trying to be the absolute best they can be. Now if your bad with computers.... or just slow this can climb even higher. I've seen some people take 5-10 per call.

Lets do 2 mins to keep it simple.

100 x 2 = 200 mins per day wasted.

So we waste **3.33333 hours per day**, on just this one process.

In sales you don't take as many days off, due to the industry, so I work 260 days per year.

> (Sigh, I hate seeing this math.)

In a year, **865.78 hours or 36 days, wasted**. Tech is supposed to be the **solution**, not the **problem**.

So for every sales person in a dealership they are wasting about $14,000 in salaries a year (about) to needlessly click buttons, that didn't need to be there in the first place.

For the average person reading this here, 'Ahh 14k is nothing'.

You work in tech and in that world it is nothing, lets be honest. But in every other industry, this is a lot of money wasted. It takes a lot effort to make a $1 in profit. Then to have it wasted, so stupidly and on a process that can be fixed is not smart business practices.

Think of the scaling problem, you have 10 sales people in your dealer? (What about the other employees?) 140,000k wasted... What if you own more than one dealer? (which most dealer/dealer groups more often than not, own more than one.) The worst part of this, our job is full of these time wasting processes that have to be done, and this is just one of them. There are also another 20 or so positions in the dealer using the same crm, but the sales side is usually where all the focus goes when building the crm. The other jobs have a worst time with it unfortunately.

### the solution

That same process, I got it down to a second. **Whether you are good at computers or not**.

That number is for clients who do not pick up the phone, or you contact them by email/text. On any other call I've gotten the number down to 10-30 seconds, can be even shorter if your good at it.

If your a programmer at a crm company or you own that company and want some guidance in this, touch base. This is a problem that needs to be addressed by more than one company. Think of the larger crms out there, lets get into those numbers quickly, these will seem impossible. (Even though the numbers above, already meet that.)

### problems at scale

Lets keep with the numbers of 10 sales people per dealer.

I know some of the bigger crm companies have more than 100 clients... This is a low number in my opinion, but we need to keep it simple and small enough to be believable.

**That one crm company, is costing their clients 14 million dollars a year in salaries.**

On a simple coding problem... That no one even dares to look at, or even bring up. When I brought it up with our dealers crm, I was discussing this issue with a high level manager. They immediately started to say, well you can cheat the system and this and that, but you can't cheat the system successfully. Ya one week your times can be shorter, but the next round of calls, your now back tracking through all your correspondence with every single customer. It doesn't save you time in any form. AND the conversation ended then and there and the crm never saw an update... That's fucking disgusting.

What if that crm company has 500 clients?

**$70 million**....

Whether your in tech or not, you cannot deny it now, that is a lot of money.
