### closing thoughts

The biggest issue that crm companies have, when selling their own crms.

Flipping the customer to their crm. It is such a huge deal for a dealer to switch crms to the point where, no matter how bad the crm is that is currently in use. They would rather stick it out with that horrible crm, and cause daily headaches for literally every single staff member, then switch because it is already in use and would cause endless headaches to make the switch. It's that big of an issue for a dealer to switch systems.

The only times a dealer does make the switch, is whenever their opening a new location or closing the entire dealer for a time, for renos for example.

Why hasn't this simple problem been fixed? It an industry wide problem. You could dominate the market if you could solve this.

Why is this crm, made by a sales person who never went to university, the only one that has the capability to easily get customers into another crm without crippling its owners with massive headaches every day in their professional lives.

If your in sales or own that crm company, you know at that point, you are not selling them.

I remember one crm sales person, we'll call him Dave, he didn't sell at all. He showed up at the dealer, at random intervals, and bugged the owners for 10 years. What a giant fucking waste of time, and I'm sorry, you fail as a sales person if thats your sales strategy. It works, barely, but go into another industry and save yourself from every horror of being in sales. Go be a regional manager at the very least, like c'mon do yourself a favour.

When I was using my crm... I didn't even tell the owners... they didn't even notice I was using a completely different system day to day... That's how unaffected the rest of the dealer was when I used this completely different system in that dealer.

(Should have I told them? No, but yes, probably, if it was any other industry. But we're in sales, beg for forgiveness, not permission.

Because you will NEVER get the permission, n e v e r.

You need to bend / break the rules, get in shit with a lot of yelling directed towards you, may even get you fired because of it. Then show / prove that it infact does do a better job (In so doing your telling your managers that they are complete morons, even when you don't say say it to their face, and they feel that your threatening their jobs now. They do not like this. lol.), then it gets implemented and everyone forgets it ever happened.

If you were able to keep your job, you won't get any thanks or bonuses, everyone will hate you anyways(mainly because your a super star sales person), but at least your job no longer sucks and you can sell more.

I have never made a worthwhile / useful improvement / impactful change in a sales environment without doing what I just went over.

Does it suck? Fuck yeah it does. I don't want to get yelled at, who would want that? But the manager, Dave, ain't doing shit around here to improve... anything for anyone's life at their job.

But get good at sales and who the fuck cares if you get fired (If they missed that opportunity to improve, sorry to say this but they're just average under achieving losers.). You just move on to the next place, because every company is looking for a rock star sales person.

I haven't been hired in a sales position, and gone through the regular hiring process in over a decade. I've always been head hunted. If I drop a resume off somewhere, it ends with the same result. We can't afford you and you will move the first opportunity that comes your way, even if I say I won't.

And push comes to shove, the only people who will do what I just talked about, to be completely honest, are rock star sales people, anyone else who reads this will just think I'm crazy... and that's ok.

One last thing on the getting fired part. IF you are in a job for more than 3 years, you are now getting left behind as far as your pay goes in the form of raises, bonuses and current industry standard pay structures. (I've only worked at one place that this was not true.)

Due to the global fuck ups that we call politicians, who seem hell bent at watching their countries burn for whatever reason that implores them to push through... the crazy / stupid policies that they do. Our $ looses its value faster than ever, how does this effect you? You would make more money, jumping from job to job every 2-3 years in your industry, does not matter what the industry is.

Your boss will not give you enough in whatever they call a pay raise at the end of the year, commission raise, doesn't matter, to ensure you keep up with the industry standards at the current time.

Not only that, due to the experience over the last 2-3 years you may even get a 10x-15x pay raise, in comparison, due to being a senior bullshitter now, congrats.

Instead of staying in that one job for 60k, you could move on to the next and make over 90k. There's nothing wrong with getting fired (Most of the time, unless it is and you did what I told you to do. Then it is in fact your fault. But you don't want to work with a bunch of losers anyways, so its a win-win. They are doing more damage to you than you know, by holding you back.), it typically comes down to the fact that the business you were working for, can no longer afford you.

The next time you get fired for no reason, just remember it's not your fault, keep your chin up and go knock it out of the park at the next gig.)

### getting back on track...

Now if you had that in your sales pitch?

You would be able to switch over so many clients to your product. But... no one does... Don't be Dave...

You get no headaches, actually comes to think of it less headaches since its removing your current problems, and save 100's of thousands in salaries a year in the process.

It would not only be detrimental to your business / dealer AND your bottom line NOT to switch, but plainly put, your a moron if you don't...

Sorry if that offends you, but there's no downside which means there's only an upside to switching. So why do you even need to think about it? You don't. I just came from the heavens and I am handing you a great solution to your problems (Some of them, you didn't even know you had.) with no draw backs.

Do you hate money sir?

Do you hate it when your employees can work better and be more effecient at completing tasks, which in turn... gives you even more money in the end?

If you still say no, you hate money and you just want to willow in the pain of your own existence and give youself nothing but headaches and take the hard path in your agonizing quest through life.

Give me one objection at this point that can't be overcome with an easy answer?

Every problem has a solution, maybe it's because I did not go to university to learn to code that gives me an advantage. Due to one reason, I truly beleive every obstacle can be over come in coding, and any solution can be elegantly implemented to where it does not burden the end user. If it does, you did it wrong. It's ok though, calm down, who cares, you can just re write the code. It's that easy. Stop stressing, tell that manager to bug off, or if you dare, to take their attitude and stick it where the sun doesn't shine, because we don't have time for that kind of attitude.

And that type of manager, shouldn't be a manager. Sorry, not sorry. I've been in sales long enough, to not beat around the bush and be 100% transparent and honest. NOT only would that person be happier in a another career, they might actually do a good job for once.

Tangent, but worth its weight in reading;

I can say this with confidence (And you cannot convince me other wise.), there are more people in sales management than not, that shouldn't even be in it to begin with. Why? Because most super star sales people, make horrible fucking managers. Sorry, but while, weirdly, some horrible sales people make great managers. More worryingly, most management positions (95% of them.) are filled out of necessity, by someone like Dave, he was what we could fill the position with at the time and it was the best we could do given the resources at hand. Do you think this a sound business practice? The best we could do, with the resources at hand will be the result you get... probably worse than that to be honest, it's Dave were talking about here.

Unfortunately, that same bad sales person manager cannot lift a sales person from the status of bottom feeder, to super stardom, they just can't... Unless they themselves get to that point first. Then they know the way, with all the struggles and successes to make that journey to the other side and become a star in sales.

But they can do the job though! The actual managing job because its a completely different position than that of a sales position, and a million % better than a super star sales person, who sucks at managing. Because sales people don't manage... anything. 90% of them can't even manage their emotions. Most sales people, they attack the first customer they can, till they have to move on to the next one. This practice does not make good managers. So why do you people keep hiring them?

Speaking of honesty and transparency, if you as a sales person make that one change, your sales career will forever change for the better. In ways you couldn't imagine, even in your wildest dreams.

Making this change, the result would be as if god himself came down from the heavens. Looked at you with all your problems and issues that was holding you down by your shoulders and removed them... Then took his time to brush off the remaining issues at a leisurely pace as if it was dust left behind, and banished them to god knows where. I shit you not.

I know, transparency and honesty are not associated with sales people, in any way shape or form. Due to the fact that the average consumer thinks we are the reincarnation of the devil himself, (Out to get every last soul to sign some horrible contract they can't get out of till the end of days, on a product they didn't even want. lol.) but if you do make that change you will be forever grateful.

I will never go back to lying, no matter how bad it seems like that conversation will be with that one customer no one wants to deal with, still won't do it.

Your life, overnight will become unfathomably easier.

The trick though? Because there is a trick to it. Admit when you don't know, because it's ok, someone out there... has the answer for you, just go get it. That asshole customer can't get mad at you for not knowing, no one knows everything.

If he does, rip his contract and tell him to shop else where. Give his deposit back and wish him a great day. Because yours just got a lot better, you will never have to deal with that prick again.
