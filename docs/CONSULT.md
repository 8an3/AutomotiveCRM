### consult

If you want a consult on how to not be one of the we discussed, touch base and we can get together. It would be worth it. I've come up with processes that are not in use in the industry, by anyone. Even the brands that try to control their dealer network, with the vast amount of resources and money at their disposal, haven't come up with some of the ideas I've implemented. To be honest, they were pretty simple solutions, BUT they have to be implemented at the right time in the process. Which means the crm company would have to implement it. There is no way they will do that for you.

I'll probably even reach out to a couple of the bigger brands that would value this.

Beleive it or not, there are brands that make it harder for their dealer network more than others to sell their products. For example, Manitou. Their product stack, is insane. Whenever I sell a brand, I always go to the competition to see how they sell it. Who sells it better, what can I take away from them so I can implement it and become better and so on. I've never seen a brand where people had so much trouble simplifying the buying process when it came to explaining the product stack and its pricing. The dealer I was at, it took 2-3 hours to price a unit out (If you were lucky), when they got good at it. That's just pricing it, nothing else. That is not discussing options with the customer, and lets be honest if it took you three hours to price it. You are not upselling your customer on anything. More often than not, what came from the factory the way it landed in the dealer, was how it was sold. It's a shame because they are missing out on so much money up selling. So why not just... make it easier? Didn't think that was a paradigm you had to wrap your head around. My quoting system, prices out a manitou unit it in under 2 minutes. Need to discuss different options? No problem, the quoting system made it dummy proof so you couldn't make a mistake selling a option that couldn't be fitted. You could have someone on their first day, input the base unit, then go over engines with the client, then interiors and so on. It's so easy, the client could do it themselves. These are stupid problems, that have solutions. People just don't want to sit down and think it through and test it to make sure, it actually saves times and if it even makes sense to implement. Again coders need to move to the next project asap, they don't have the luxury to complete this step.
