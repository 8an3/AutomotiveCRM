            To learn more about the features, there is in-depth documentation organized by department or position, including a dedicated section for salespeople. Spending time with this documentation will help you get the most out of this application. With the intuitive design, if you have used a CRM before, you will quickly adapt without needing the documentation. However, the documentation contains many valuable tips to help you increase your sales, so don't skip it entirely.
            <br />
            One of the most significant advantages is a process that addresses one of the biggest challenges in the sales department: the finance hand-off. Often, this hand-off isn't smooth unless the customer leaves and schedules a time to return and sign. Usually, this doesn't happen, and there's a risk they might be followed up by another dealer offering a better deal. Our application handles this gracefully, in a way that we're surprised no one has thought of before. To learn about this feature, you'll need to explore the documentation.

            The sales calendar can be used as your main dashboard or for referencing and editing appointments for your department and others. This calendar was developed by salespeople for salespeople. Most CRMs do a poor job with the sales calendar, either because the designers don't use it themselves or don't understand the needs of salespeople.
            <br />
            Our calendar, along with the dashboard, went through countless revisions to get it right. Admittedly, the dashboard underwent more revisions, but both tools are crucial for salespeople. These two features can either help you succeed and become a rock star or waste so much of your time that you become just another struggling salesperson.

            Our in-house script builder helps you create scripts easily without needing another tool or system. It also provides a plethora of scripts from our own sales books. If you have scripts you'd like to add, feel free to email us with your suggestions. Scripts are a powerful tool, more so than you might think.
            <br />
            When it hits 5 pm and there's still an hour left, but you're out of ideas for talking to customers after a full day of calling, I like to go through the catalog of scripts I have while waiting for people to pick up the phone. This routine has often helped me generate new scripts. A sales coach once caught me doing this and noted that I had talked to over 250 people that day and was running out of ideas. This simple routine of re-reading my own scripts helps me think of new topics, generate more scripts, or refine the ones I already have. It helps me perfect the wording needed to get a customer to make a deposit and buy.
            <br />
            A well-written script takes hours to create. If you're already waiting for calls to be picked up, why not use that time to improve your toolkit?
