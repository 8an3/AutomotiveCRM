When I know every script, rebuttal and overcome a sales person can learn, how else can I improve and make more money? This was the biggest crux to fix and I'm sick and tired of crm's wasting my time, making me do more steps in the sales process that arent needed. Or not even addressing the the bigger ones. I've always pushed to be the best, and thats what you will get.

I'm that confident.", },

And I'm talking about the biggest products on the market. Or maybe your just an average store that does average sales, then this is an even better product for you. It doesn't cost as much as the 'bigger' brand names, with more features out of the gate. I not only made the near perfect crm for sales people (since I'm always improving it), I took that same attitude to every position in the dealer. The owner shouldn't have to look at the same dash as the sales people and try to decipher a bunch of data to get information they need to make informed decisions on sales and such. No two positions in the dealer need the same data.", },

It shouldn't take 5 minutes to find the information to answer a simple question. Navigating 32 pages to see if something is in stock for a unit. So I tailor made every position/role's section of the app and they will be able to expect a lot better experience.", },
